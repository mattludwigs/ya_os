Booting with out grub section

Currently the main way to load the OS is using grub, but for learning reason this area works through loading with grub

This also should** work on Mac OSX while the main grub booting is better done on Linux.

`brew install nasm qemu`

To run:

`make run`

You might have to look through your open windows, as my qemu gets open behind other applications running for some reason
